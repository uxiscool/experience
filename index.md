    I’m Vladimir — UX enthusiast and interaction architect based in Moscow, Russia.<br><br>
    I’m passionate about a systematic approach to design and believe that real product value starts with well-thought-out user journeys. I love working on a wide variety of interfaces, with a special passion for internal tools and complex B2B web services.<br><br>
    My experience covers different project roles: from solo contributor to core team member. I enjoy tackling business tasks, building structure out of chaos, and making digital products truly useful and delightful for people.<br><br>
    Open to collaboration and always excited to solve new challenges.
